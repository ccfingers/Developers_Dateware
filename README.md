Developer's Dateware Demo
The Develooper's Dateware source code is proprietary and kepted. 

1st) You need the window's "c:\users\usrname\......." setup directory structure. Like windows 7 and windows 10 has. 
2nd) The DevDateWare.dll file either goes in the c:\windows\system directory or the c:\windows\system32 directory.  
           I've using the c:\windows\system  directory. 
3rd) There are 144 different date formats to choose from.
4th) There are a few shortcuts to use. E.g.: 'Today', 'Now', 'yester' - w/o the quotes.
5th) I'm looking for a few developers to pound on the program to surface out some bugs.
6th) Plus, I'm also looking for a some new ideas to help out.
7th) I'm looking for feedback, Please...
